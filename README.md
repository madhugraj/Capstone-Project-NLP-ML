# Capstone-Project-NLP-ML
# Problem Statement:
1.	Car Popularity Prediction: 
a.	In this project, the train dataset consisted of various features a car has and the target variable was “popularity” ranging from 0-4.
b.	Depending upon the features, we had to predict the car popularity on test dataset.
c.	Practiced ways to tune a random forest to get optimum model setup

2.	In News Category prediction:
a.	There was just 1 dependent variable “Story”, which consisted the story of the news and the target variable was “Category” which ranged from 0-3, each number denoting a category of news.
b.	Learnt to implement very important preprocessing technique called lemmatization.
c.	Since machine learning only works on numerical values and not on strings, it was quite essential to understand the string conversion methods.
